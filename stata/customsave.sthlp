{phang2}{cmdab:customsave} {hline 2} Adds metadata to a dataset and optionally checks that identifiers are unique and non-missing.

{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmdab:customsave} is a small utility that adds standardized metadata to
	datasets and optionally checks the quality of the ID variable. Only
	takes one variable as identifier.

{pstd}The command also a few forms of meta data to the data set. This is
	useful for future users and for transparency. Metadata is added
	using {cmdab:char}, which stores meta data to the data set using an
	associative array, see {help char} for an explanation.
	The command also labels the data set with the name of the do file that
	created it, the last date that it was modified, and the current user. A
	longer data note additionally adds the name an optional longer description.

{p2col : Charname}Metadata associated with the charname{p_end}
{p2line}
{p2col :{cmdab:_dta[config_idvar]}}stores the name of the ID variable.{p_end}
{p2col :{cmdab:_dta[config_version]}}stores the Stata version used
 	to create the data set. Retrieved from {cmdab:c(version)}.{p_end}
{p2col :{cmdab:_dta[config_date]}}stores the date the file was saved. Copying files,
	or sharing them via email can change the time stamp you see; this is more
	reliable. Retrieved from {cmdab:c(current_date)}.{p_end}
{p2col :{cmdab:_dta[config_user]}}stores user name (either from
	{cmdab:c(username)} or chosen by user.{p_end}
{p2col :{cmdab:_dta[config_host]}}stores computer name (from {cmdab:c(hostname)}).{p_end}

{title:Options}

{phang}{cmdab:idvar:name(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} specifies the ID variable that is
	supposed to fully and uniquely identify the data set. Only one variable
	is allowed in {it:varname}.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:filename} is the name of the data set to be saved.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:path} is the directory to save in.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:dofile:name} is the name of the dofile that modified the
	dataset.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:description} adds optional longer comment.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:user} changes the username in the metadata from the one in
 	c(username).{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:noidok} skips checks of ID variable. But it still outputs an
	obnoxious comment in your log file noting that you really should think
	through your ID variable.{p_end}

{title:Examples}

{pstd} {hi:Example 1}

{pmore}{inp:customsave, idvarname(hhid) filename(superCleanData) path($projectfolder/dataWork/Analysis/dataSets) dofile(lastDoFile.do)}

{pmore}This minimal example checks that the variable {it:hhid}
uniquely and fully identifies that data set, and saves meta data to the
data set using char, a data label, and a note.

{pstd} {hi:Example 2}

{pmore}{inp:customsave, idvarname(hhid) filename(superCleanData) path($projectfolder/dataWork/Analysis/dataSets) dofile(lastDoFile.do) noidok}

{pmore}This adds the same metadata as in Example 1, but skips the ID checks.
